# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git tracks progress. Makes it easier to remember how we got from point A to point B |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | It's a CSS command that changes something when an action takes place |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | It's a way of having multiple rules performing in a specific order |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | I'd imagine it would do some things that you wouldn't want. It would cancel out some rules and properties that you laid out that you didn't intend on over riding |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector, property, value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | We eat with our eyes first. You can covey what is important, what common things your website provides first and foremost through design |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | I don't feel like I understand this completely. I think it's kind of like an outline of an essay. It gives you the basic layout you want before you add detail. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Assuming my answer above is correct, I think it depends on each individual. Some people need that structure. Personally, I don't think I'll utilize it |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | "...it is used to set the length of flexible items". A way to flex and shrink and stretch certain items. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Padding, height, width I believe is all of them |
