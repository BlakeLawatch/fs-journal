## Prompts

- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week has been a good mix of highs and lows. I failed my 2 strike checkpoint which had me down in a big way, even though I knew it technically didn't matter. I talked to Jeremy and he gave me some words of encouragement and things to help me before finals week. 

As for the Capstone part of things, it's going fairly well. I'm in the group of 5 which I don't love. It takes too much time to figure things out when there are 5 voices going at a time. Figuring out the details of everything is easier said than done. The more detailed you try to get on a certain thing, the more you realize that you can go into even more and more detail and it can become overwhelming. What has gone well is us getting along and every body having a say. I don't think anyone feels unheard or like they're not a part of the team. The thing I struggle with the most in this full stack style application, is connecting the dots between the back end and the front end. I have a good understanding of the front end, but trying to make a back end out of that is kind of confusing to me.

The biggest thing I'd count as a victory, is being on a balanced team and having a balanced approach. No one is doing their own thing, and no one is going to carry the team on their shoulders. It's going to be a team effort and hopefully our final product shows that.
