# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asynchronous is a method that makes it easier to test data. It helps when some functions or callbacks take longer to do than others. Synchronous code starts at the top and runs in order till you get to the end.|

02. What is an event listener?

  > | It's a way for JS to wait for an event to happen and move it along to the next step |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer. It's how certain programs talk to eachother |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | They're both functions that are called inside of other functions. The only difference is a higher order function is called as a parameter (I think?) |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is a way to get something in the future, whether it's wrong or right. Use it with chaining and with an if/else type of statement. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Post, Get, Put |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | a function must be defined as async |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | Helps keeps things organized to make debugging easier and to make sure it's safe. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | A bad request. Generally user error when typing in a URL |
