# Intro to JavaScript
01. Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?

    > | Let, Var, and Const |

02. What is the definition of a function?

    > | A subprogram designed to perform a particular task |

03. What are the `SOLID` principles?

    > | They're 5 rules that help keep and maintain clear and concise code |

04. Given this array: How could you remove the `pineapple`?

    ```js
    let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'orange', 'strawberry']
    ```

    > | shift...? I don't quite understand|

05. Given these two objects: How could you add each to the others friends arrays?

    ```js
    let you = {
        name: "You",
        hair: true,
        friends: []
    }
    let them = {
        name: "Them",
        hair: false,
        friends: []
    }
    ```

    > | you.friends.push(them)
    them.friends.push(you) |

06. Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:

    > | an if statement is what we have used the most I believe |

07. What is the main difference between `parameters` and `arguments`?

    > | An argument is a rule, a parameter is a variable that has been set to a certain condition |

08. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

    > | comment anchors I suppose. It's a different way, but I don't think it's better...? Also, Micks debugging tool |

09. What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?

    > | Primitive values are locked in values like numbers and booleans. References are data sets in a way like arrays that you reference to later |

10. Demonstrate a loop that prints the numbers between -100 and 100?

    > | for (let i = -100; i < 101; i++){

    } |
